    Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also
    includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.
    Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone,
    which is used for control of buoyancy.

<h2>Range and Habitad</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish,
    inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters.
    They are mostly shallow-water animals, although
    they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10]

<h2>Anatomy abd Physiology</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Visual system</h3>
<p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes.</p>
<h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
<p>The blood of a cuttlefish is an unusual shade of green-blue,
    because it uses the copper-containing protein haemocyanin
    to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing
    protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood.</p>
